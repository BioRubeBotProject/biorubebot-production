# BioRubeBot (Production)
This is the git repository for the production version of BioRubeBot.

The master branch in this repository contains the version of the game
used in testing and for classroom use.    Development MUST occur in the
biorubebot-dev repository - only release branches from that repo and
hotfix branches in this repo should be pushed to the master branch.

The Project is currently compiled under Unity Version 5.5.0f3.
